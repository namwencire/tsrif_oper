Please enjoy this sililoque from Hamlet and know, that it was all typed from analog memory and not found on the internet (which explains the mediocrity of it).
To be, or not to be. That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings arrow of outrageous forture, or to take arms against them.
